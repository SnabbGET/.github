Hello there! Do you know SnabbGET? If you don't, let me introduce you to it...

## What do we do? 🧐

We are actively working on our SnabbGET terminal project, wich is a terminal with a GUI. It means that you won't type any commands 
(you will be able to do it but actually we don't really designed it for that).

## Why?

SnabbGET guified terminal will be intuitive for beginners. 
The idea of creating a terminal like that came out because we tought that it's pretty easy to be lost using a terminal, as a beginner.
And we are mainly lost because we use commands, parameters...
With our terminal, you won't be able to be lost! We will do our best to do the most beginner-friendly & easy to use terminal.
